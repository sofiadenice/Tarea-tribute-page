    <h1>RPG Tribute Page</h1>
    <p>A role-playing game (sometimes spelled roleplaying game; abbreviated RPG) is a game in which players assume the
        roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a
        narrative, either through literal acting, or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character
        development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and
        guidelines.</p>
    <p>There are several forms of role-playing games. The original form, sometimes called the tabletop role-playing game
        (TRPG), is conducted through discussion, whereas in live action role-playing (LARP), players physically perform
        their characters' actions. In both of these forms, an arranger called a game master (GM) usually decides on the
        rules and setting to be used, while acting as the referee; each of the other players takes on the role of a
        single character.</p>
    <p>Single player role-playing video games form a loosely defined genre of computer and console games with origins in
        role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons, on which they base much of their terminology, settings, and game
        mechanics.[21] This translation changes the experience of the game, providing a visual representation of the
        world but emphasizing statistical character development over collaborative, interactive storytelling.</p>
